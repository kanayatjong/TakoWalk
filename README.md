# TakoWalk
TakoWalk is a daily steps tracking application that utilizes Apple HealthKit Technology. In this application, users take on the role of an alien named Tako, who is responsible for refueling their customer's rockets. There are two types of rockets that need to be refueled: a large rocket (1000 steps) and a small rocket (500 steps). By successfully refueling the rockets, users earn coins that they can use to purchase skills to increase their score. The gamification aspect of this application aims to motivate users to walk more each day, with a daily goal of 4,000 steps (1000 steps above the current average daily steps of Indonesians and 1000 steps below the global average daily steps).

This application is designed for Indonesian citizen aged 13-25 who want to improve their daily steps to stay fit and avoid diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and others. Indonesia is currently known as the country with the lowest walking activity, where the average daily steps in Indonesia is 3500 steps. Meanwhile, the global average daily steps is 5000 steps, and Hong Kong has the highest average daily steps at 6000 steps.
